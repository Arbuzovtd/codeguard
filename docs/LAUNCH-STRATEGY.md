## Timeline and Milestones

### Week 1: Landing Page + Initial Distribution
**Objective:** 50-100 email signups
- Publish landing page
- Post on r/Cursor with real quotes and screenshots

- Capture top objections and feature requests

### Week 4: VS Code Extension Beta

- Validate false positive rate and speed

### Week 6: Early Revenue
**Objective:** 10+ paying customers

---

## Budget
- Total: $0-100 (organic + small ads)
- Primary channels: Reddit, Hacker News, X

---

## Messaging Focus
- "Stop AI from destroying your code"
- "Block destructive diffs before they apply"
- Use real developer quotes from research

---

## Success Criteria
- Week 1: 50-100 signups

## Problem Section

### Heading (H2) - Using Developer Quote
```
"Cursor destroyed months of development even though I only asked it to update the UI"
```

**Alternative (professional):**
```
AI changes are fast. Recovery is not.
```

### Subheading
```
Diff views show what changed, but they do not tell you if it is dangerous.
```

### Pain Points (Bullets with Quotes)
```
❌ "AI deleted 90% of file content when I asked to update README"
   Reality: Large deletions slip through without warning.

❌ "Database has reset 3 times in last 24 hours due to AI ignoring rules"
   Reality: Out-of-scope edits hit critical files.

❌ "I spend MORE time debugging AI code than writing manually"
   Reality: Post-factum recovery burns hours.

❌ "There's no safety net - one wrong response destroys everything"
   Reality: Existing tools only help after damage.
```

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

**DO:**
- Use developer language and real quotes
- Be concrete about risk, diffs, and protected files
- Keep tone technical and direct
- Emphasize proactive prevention over recovery

**DON'T:**
- Use marketing fluff
- Overpromise AI accuracy
- Make vague claims
- Sound like a generic productivity app

**Key principle:** 
"Speak like you're explaining to a developer who has already been burned by AI mistakes."

### Problem Section

#### Heading (Using Developer Quote)
```
"Cursor destroyed months of development even though I only asked it to update the UI"
```

**Alternative (Technical):**
```
AI changes are fast. Recovery is not.
```

#### Subheading
```
Diff views show what changed, but they do not tell you if it is dangerous.
```

#### Pain Points (4 Bullets with Real Quotes)
```
❌ "AI deleted 90% of file content when I asked to update README"
   Reality: Large deletions often slip through unnoticed.

❌ "Database has reset 3 times in last 24 hours due to AI ignoring rules"
   Reality: Out-of-scope edits hit critical files.

❌ "I spend MORE time debugging AI code than writing manually"
   Reality: Post-factum recovery burns hours.

❌ "There's no safety net - one wrong response destroys everything"
   Reality: Existing tools only help after damage.

```
Analyze risk before apply. Block what is dangerous. Restore in one click.
```

#### 3-Step Process
```
1. Intercept
   AI generates changes and CodeGuard pauses before apply.

2. Analyze

   Generate a risk score with clear reasons.

3. Decide
   Block, review details, or allow anyway.
   Restore point is created automatically.

## Email Marketing Tone

### Welcome Email
**Tone:** Direct, technical, short

**Template:**
```
Hey [Name],

You are in for CodeGuard.

Quick question: what is the worst AI change you have seen in your codebase?
Hit reply with the file and the diff size. Real examples help us tune risk detection.

- [Your name]
```

### Story Email
**Tone:** Honest, problem-first

**Template:**
```
Subject: AI deleted 90 percent of a file when I asked for a README update

Hey [Name],

This is a real quote from research: "AI deleted 90% of file content when I asked to update README".
It is the most common failure mode we saw.

CodeGuard exists because diff views are not enough. We block destructive edits before apply and create a restore point automatically.
